*********************************
Introducing edx.org and edX Edge
*********************************

EdX hosts courses on the `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_ websites.

* The edx.org website has massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are designed
  and led by edX partner organizations. This website lists all available
  courses publicly, and learners from around the world can find and enroll in
  these courses.

* EdX Edge has small private online courses (SPOCs), which are often created
  for use on campus or within an organization. Courses on Edge frequently limit
  enrollment. Edge does not list available courses publicly. To enroll in a
  course on Edge, you must receive an email message with an invitation to
  enroll and the course URL from the course team. You do not need to create an
  account on Edge unless you have received an invitation to enroll in an Edge
  course.

.. note::  The user accounts on edx.org and edX Edge are separate. If you take
   courses on both websites, you must complete the account registration
   process on each of the two sites.

.. Bring in the content that use to be in include file /shared/students/Section_register_account.rst because it is no longer shared and does not appear at all in the Open edX Learner's Guide (CT June 2016 DOC-3085). Also insert references to mobile app.

You can create an account for edx.org or edX Edge in different ways.

* You can create an entirely new edx.org or edX Edge account.
* You can use an existing social media account, such as a Facebook or Google
  account, to create an edx.org or edX Edge account.
* On edX Edge, if your organization provides linked accounts, you can use your
  account with that organization to create an edX Edge account.

.. note::
  If you do not use an existing social media or linked organization account to
  create an edX account, you can still link these external accounts to your edX
  account later. For more information, see :ref:`Link Accounts`. If you link
  your accounts, you sign in to your edX.org or edX Edge account automatically
  whenever you sign in to the external account.

Creating an account for edx.org or edX Edge has two steps.

#. :ref:`Create an account <edX Create an Account>` on the edX.org or edX Edge
   website, or from the edX mobile app (for edX.org accounts only).
#. :ref:`Activate the account <edX Activate an Account>` by using an email
   message that you receive automatically after your account is created.

.. _edX Create an Account:

==================
Create an Account
==================

You create, or register, an edx.org or edX Edge account on the account
registration page. For edx.org, you can also register from the edX mobile app.

To register an account on edx.org or edX Edge, follow these steps.

.. note::
  When you register an account, you specify a username that will represent you
  throughout the edx.org or edX Edge site. Course team members and other
  learners only see your username. You cannot change your username after you
  create your account. EdX recommends that you select your username carefully.

#. Go to the edx.org or edX Edge registration page.

   * For edx.org, go to https://courses.edx.org/register or open the edX
     mobile app.
   * For edX Edge, go to https://edge.edx.org/register.
   * If you received an email invitation for a course, follow the instructions
     in the email message to go to the correct registration page.

#. (Optional) To link your external social media or organization account to the
   edX account that you are about to create, select the external account that
   you want, and follow the steps on the page that opens. After you follow the
   steps on that page, you return to the edx.org or edX Edge registration page.

#. On the registration page, enter the required information for your new
   account. Fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

   On Edge, if you linked your account to an organization account, some of this
   information might be provided for you.

#. (Optional) Enter additional information, such as your date of birth. This
   information can help course teams better understand their learners and
   improve their courses.

#. Select the check box to accept the edX terms of service and honor code.

#. Select **Create your account**.

When you create your account, edX sends an account activation email message to
the email address that you provided. This message contains instructions for
activating your account. You must use this email message to activate your
account before you enroll in any courses.

If you linked your edX Edge account to an organization account, your account
might be activated and you might be enrolled in your course automatically. If
that is true, you will go directly to your dashboard, where your course will be
visible.

.. _edX Activate an Account:

====================
Activate an Account
====================

.. note::
  If you sign out of your edx.org or edX Edge account, you cannot sign in again
  until you activate your account. You also cannot enroll in any courses until
  you activate your account.

To activate your account, you use the email message that you receive from edX
when you create your account.

#. In your email client, locate the account activation message from edX. If you
   do not see this message, your email client may have categorized the message
   as spam.
#. Follow the instructions in the activation email message to activate your
   account.

After you activate your account, your browser automatically opens to an
"Activation Complete" page that contains a link to your dashboard.

After you create and activate your account, if you want to modify your account
information, reset your password, or link or unlink accounts, go to the
:ref:`Account Settings <SFD Account Settings>` page.
